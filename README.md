# XILICO-804K

Xilicon is a text generation package based on the Deeplearning4j framework. It trains a deep recurrent neural network (RNN) using Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) layers on a given text dataset to learn and predict sequences of text. The generated text imitates the style and structure of the training data, which makes it suitable for various applications such as text generation, chatbots, and more.

## Features

- Trains an RNN with multiple LSTM layers
- Generates text based on learned patterns
- Supports custom text datasets for training
- Saves the trained model for future use

## Getting Started

To use this package, you will need to have the Deeplearning4j framework installed in your project.

### Prerequisites
